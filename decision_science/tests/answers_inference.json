{
    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\nBased on the statsmodels analysis, 'MEDIAN_AGE' has a positive coefficients meaning it is associated with a positive effect on the number of crime incidents what could be counter-intuitive. However its associated p-value is above 0.05 meaning this coefficient cannot be considered as trustworthy\n",
    "T_STAT": "\nThe t-statistic measures the distance between the coefficient found and the mean of the gaussian if the null hypothesis were true. This measure is given in number of standard deviations of the gaussian of the null hypothesis. Hence if t is very high, the probability of having this coefficient value, knowing the null hypothesis is true, would be low. This would then mean that the null hypothesis could be rejected.\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\nThe p-value represents the probability to get that coefficient if the null hypothesis (all coefficients are null) were true. Basically it is the chance that this finding was due to pure chance. Its effect are not statistically significant are not significant at the 95% confidence level and 90% confidence level as its associated p-value is above 0.05\n",
    "INCREASE": "\nWe chose to scale the features in our statsmodels analysis above. Hence we need to apply the same transformation to our percentage point of married couple in the district to derive its true impact on the NB_INCIDENTS based on the coefficients showed in the summary above (-15060). Scaling by 'PERC_MARRIED_COUPLE_FAMILY' mean and std we find a variation of (-15060-31.21)/7.436453 = -2030.\nBesides if we look at the below summary done on unscaled fetaures we find the approximate same value (-2115).\nHence, as a conclusion, we could say that, holding all other regressors constant, the total number of incidents decrease by around 2100 when the share of families with a married couple increases by 1 percentage point in the district (and with a 95% interval confidence of [-3164.866, -1065.502])\n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\nMost of the p-values found here are too high and the F-statistic is not high enough to deem this analysis as statistically significant. The main limitation in my opinion is the multicolinearity of the features (see below) and the low number of datapoints we are feeding our to our model. That's the reason why we find so large standard errors. \n"
